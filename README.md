# BigData-Spark

You are provided with Craft Brewery data to perform basic data analysis using Spark. The data includes three files:

•	Beers.csv 

•	Breweries.csv

•	Dictionary.doc

Use the above csv files and execute the following: 

1.	Import the brewery.csv into Sqoop
2.	Create RDD for Beers.csv
3.	Move the brewery.csv into Spark from Sqoop (intermediate movement to another component in Hadoop is fine)
4.	For the following questions use Spark SQL

a.	Determine the number of breweries in each state

b.	Determine the cities with most breweries

c.	Calculate the average alcohol % by volume in each state

d.	Determine the beer styles with highest average alcohol by volume

e.	Determine the most brewed beer style

5. Using MlLib to predict either beerstyle or abv content. You can use any statistical or machine learning model to predict. You can also come up with your own problem statement, and predict using any model available in MlLib.
